## 📖 Description
Shopping Manager is a **household shopping list app** built with a focus on simplicity, collaboration, and great design.  
Unlike messy notes apps, it is designed specifically for collaborative shopping and so it provides **shared lists** with features like priorities, notes, suggestions and much more.  

Key highlights:
- **Household support** – create or join a household and share shopping lists with everyone in it.  
- **Item priority levels** – mark items as Normal or High or Urgent.
- **Optional notes** – add context to your shopping items. 
- **Sign In securely with Google** for quick and easy access.   
- **Auto-archiving** – seperates old lists in the UI for a clean look
- **Create local lists** stored on-device for solo use. 
- **Modern UI** – built with Material 3 & Jetpack Compose.  

This app is backed by a **Supabase** backend, with additional support from **Firebase**.
